### Hi! I'm Antonio a.k.a. "Tonix" ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student at NorOff School of Technology and Digital Media taking a front-end development course. It is a 2 years vocational course which will be finished on December 2023.

### What I learned so far:

  - Making prototype using Adobe XD.
  - Building website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  - Using relevant tools to check website WCAG Compliance such as [Contrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com/).
  - Using project development tools such [Trello](https://trello.com/).
  - Using [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Google Spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/sheets) as CMS.
  - REST API Methods such as "GET", "PUT/PATCH","DELETE" and "POST".
  - Advance Javascript ( Destructuring and Array methods ).
  - Bootstrap 5 with SASS.
  - Using get commands for version control.
  - Using development dependencies such as (Prettier, Eslint, Jest and Cypress).
  - Using Javascript frameworks [React](https://react.dev/).
  - Using React UI framework [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
 
 ### What we're doing as of now:
  This is my last semester as a front-end development student at Noroff. With our final project, we need to use all the knowledge we have learned since the beginning. From designing and prototyping to using a Javascript framework.
